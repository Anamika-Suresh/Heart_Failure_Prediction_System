 "Heart Failure Prediction System," is a Python-based application designed to
 assist users in predicting the likelihood of heart failure based on various health parameters.It
 involves user registration and login, where users provide essential information to facilitate
 heart failure predictions. The parameters encompass age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood
 pressure, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved,
 exercise-induced angina, slope, coronary arteries count, and Thalassemia. Leveraging the
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the system analyzes these inputs to detect the
 presence of heart disease.The heart failure prediction system utilizes a dataset sourced from
 the UCI repository, containing 13 crucial attributes related to heart disease. These attributes
 form the basis for training and evaluating the KNN model, which serves as the core predictive
 component of the system. A chatbot has been integrated into the KNN algorithm within the
 result page. After users input various parameters during the prediction process, the system
 displays the predicted result alongside a chatbot interface. Users can engage with the chatbot
 to inquire about heart disease-related queries, fostering a user-friendly and informative
 interaction.The project aims to provide a robust, accessible, and user-centric solution for heart
 failure prediction, leveraging machine learning algorithms and natural language processing
 through the integration of a chatbot. The implementation follows a secure login mechanism
 for both users and administrators, ensuring data privacy and system integrity. The combination
 of KNN-based prediction and chatbot-driven interactions enhances the system's functionality
 and user engagement, contributing to a comprehensive and effective heart health prediction
 platform.
